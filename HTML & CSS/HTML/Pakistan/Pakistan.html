    <p>Pakistan was created, as an Islamic state, out of the partition of the UK’s Indian Empire, at independence in August 1947.</p>
   <p>	It originally consisted of two parts, West Pakistan (now Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), separated by 1,600 km of Indian territory. </p>
   <p>Partition was followed by war with India over Kashmir and the mass migration of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs to resettle within the new borders, an upheaval which led to violence, financial loss and death on a large scale. </p>
<p>the arrival of Indian Muslims and departure of Pakistan’s Hindus and Sikhs, Pakistan became an almost entirely Muslim society. 
Jinnah, who is honoured as the Quaid-i-Azam, or great leader, died in 1948.</p>
